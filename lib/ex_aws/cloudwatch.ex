  Gets statistics for the specified metric.

  The maximum number of data points returned from a single call is 1,440. If
  you request more than 1,440 data points, CloudWatch returns an error. To
  reduce the number of data points, you can narrow the specified time range
  and make multiple requests across adjacent time ranges, or you can increase
  the specified period. Data points are not returned in chronological order.

  CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that
  you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period,
  CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each
  one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch
  is larger than the number of data points returned.

  CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you
  publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile
  statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

  The sample_count value of the statistic set is 1.
  The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal.

  Amazon CloudWatch retains metric data as follows:

  * Data points with a period of less than 60 seconds are available for 3
    hours. These data points are high-resolution metrics and are available
    only for custom metrics that have been defined with a StorageResolution
    of 1.
  * Data points with a period of 60 seconds (1-minute) are available for
    15 days.
  * Data points with a period of 300 seconds (5-minute) are available for
    63 days.
  * Data points with a period of 3600 seconds (1 hour) are available for
    455 days (15 months).
  * Data points that are initially published with a shorter period are
    aggregated together for long-term storage. For example, if you collect
    data using a period of 1 minute, the data remains available for 15 days
    with 1-minute resolution. After 15 days, this data is still available,
    but is aggregated and retrievable only with a resolution of 5 minutes.
    After 63 days, the data is further aggregated and is available with a
    resolution of 1 hour.

  CloudWatch started retaining 5-minute and 1-hour metric data as of
  July 9, 2016.

  Creates a dashboard if it does not already exist, or updates an existing
  dashboard.

  If you update a dashboard, the entire contents are replaced with what
  you specify here.

  You can have up to 500 dashboards per account. All dashboards in your
  account are global, not region-specific.

  A simple way to create a dashboard using put_dashboard/2 is to copy an
  existing dashboard. To copy an existing dashboard using the console, you
  can load the dashboard and then use the View/edit source command in the
  Actions menu to display the JSON block for that dashboard. Another way to
  copy a dashboard is to use `get_dashboard/1`, and then use the data
  returned within dashboard_body as the template for the new dashboard
  when you call `put_dashboard/2`.

  When you create a dashboard with put_dashboard/2 , a good practice is to add a text widget at the top of the
  dashboard with a message that the dashboard was created by script and should not be changed in the console.
  This message could also point console users to the location of the dashboard_body script or the CloudFormation
  template used to create the dashboard.

  Creates or updates an alarm and associates it with the specified metric.

  Optionally, this operation can associate one or more Amazon SNS resources
  with the alarm.

  When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set
  to INSUFFICIENT_DATA . The alarm is evaluated and its state is set
  appropriately. Any actions associated with the state are then executed.

  When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the
  update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

  If you are an IAM user, you must have Amazon EC2 permissions for some operations:

  ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus and ec2:DescribeInstances for all alarms on EC2 instance status metrics
  ec2:StopInstances for alarms with stop actions
  ec2:TerminateInstances for alarms with terminate actions
  ec2:DescribeInstanceRecoveryAttribute and ec2:RecoverInstances for alarms with recover actions
  If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2, you can still
  create an alarm, but the stop or terminate actions are not performed. However, if you are later granted
  the required permissions, the alarm actions that you created earlier are performed.

  If you are using an IAM role (for example, an EC2 instance profile), you cannot stop or terminate the
  instance using alarm actions. However, you can still see the alarm state and perform any other actions
  such as Amazon SNS notifications or Auto Scaling policies.

  If you are using temporary security credentials granted using AWS STS, you cannot stop or terminate an
  EC2 instance using alarm actions.

  You must create at least one stop, terminate, or reboot alarm using either the Amazon EC2 or CloudWatch
  consoles to create the EC2ActionsAccess IAM role. After this IAM role is created, you can create stop,
  terminate, or reboot alarms using a command-line interface or API.

  Publishes metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch.

  CloudWatch associates the data points with the specified metric.
  If the specified metric does not exist, CloudWatch creates the metric.
  When CloudWatch creates a metric, it can take up to fifteen minutes for
  the metric to appear in calls to ListMetrics .

  Each PutMetricData request is limited to 40 KB in size for HTTP POST requests.

  Although the Value parameter accepts numbers of type Double, CloudWatch rejects
  values that are either too small or too large. Values must be in the range
  of 8.515920e-109 to 1.174271e+108 (Base 10) or 2e-360 to 2e360 (Base 2).
  In addition, special values (for example, NaN, +Infinity, -Infinity) are
  not supported.

  You can use up to 10 dimensions per metric to further clarify what data the
  metric collects. For more information about specifying dimensions, see
  Publishing Metrics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

  Data points with time stamps from 24 hours ago or longer can take at least
  48 hours to become available for GetMetricStatistics from the time they are
  submitted.

  CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics. If you
  publish data using a statistic set instead, you can only retrieve percentile
  statistics for this data if one of the following conditions is true:

  * The SampleCount value of the statistic set is 1
  * The Min and the Max values of the statistic set are equal

  ## Example
      iex> metric_data = [
      ...>   [metric_name: "My Metric Name", value: 1.0],
      ...>   [metric_name: "My Metric Name", value: 1.5],
      ...>   [metric_name: "My Metric Name", value: 2.0],
      ...> ]

  Retrieves a snapshot graph of one or more Amazon CloudWatch metrics as
  a bitmap image.

  You can then embed this image into your services and products, such as
  wiki pages, reports, and documents. You could also retrieve images
  regularly, such as every minute, and create your own custom live
  dashboard.

  There is a limit of 20 transactions per second for this API. Each
  GetMetricWidgetImage action has the following limits:

  * As many as 100 metrics in the graph.
  * Up to 100 KB uncompressed payload.

  ## Examples:
      iex> ExAws.Cloudwatch.get_metric_widget_image("{\"metrics\":[[\"AWS/EC2\", \"CPUUtilization\", \"InstanceId\", \"i-1234567890abcdef0\"]]}")
      %ExAws.Operation.Query{
